## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.


Our project is a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker. The user would input their name and password to create a profile along with whether they are a trader or miner. Once the user has signed-up they would login and see their portfolio. We are using an external API in order to display information around the cryptocurrency. 

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.

## MVP

-Data Visualization of the users cryptocurrency portfolio
-Using an external API (CoinMarketCap and CryptoCurrency NewsAPI) to render information 
around the user's portfolio 
-Having User Authentication (User-Only no strangers allowed because of sensitive data)
-CRUD around people commenting about their investments on their portfolio (Creating comments around their coin, 
editing/updating those comments, deleting the comments they disregard around their coin, and reading their comments)
